# xGmodel---Logistic-Regression-in-R
Creating a soccer expected goals (xG) model in R using logistic regression

Expected Goals or xG predicts the probability of a shot ending up in a goal in a game of soccer. I used logistic regression in R to get done with this project.
I thank Understat.com for their wide range of soccer shot data, the data in my model comes from Understat.com
